## Introduction

This project demonstrates how-to of hosting [`zadam/trilium`](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) on your AWS
infrastructure. If you want to host your very own personal knowledge base on AWS, this project could be a good starting
point. You can easily use this project as a boilerplate for managing your trilium hosting infrastructure in IaC way,
automatic infrastructure provisioning, frequent drift-checking, and more. And also
([@cednore](https://github.com/cednore)) uses this repository to manage his own trilium hosting as well üòâ.

Before you start, it is strongly recommended to read [trilium wiki](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki) first,
especially [server installation/deployment page](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Docker-server-installation).

### What's included

1. A single terraform project defining hosting infrastructure and provisioners
2. Auto-generated [terraform documentation](#terraform-documentation)
3. [GitHub action](https://github.com/cednore/trilium/actions/workflows/check.yml) for infrastructure drift checking (on
   every push, scheduled)
4. Time-saving development scripts
5. Guides and documentations

### Infrastructure summary

1. Single **VPC** with 3 public/private subnets
2. App instance on **EC2** (default `t3.micro`), publicly accessible via SSH
3. **Docker**ized app container (default count `1`)
4. Frontline **ALB** with HTTP/HTTPS listeners
5. **ACM** certificate attached to ALB (use apex domain's ACM by default, assuming this covers subdomains as well)
6. **EBS** data volume attached (default 20GB)
7. **CloudWatch event rule** to backup data volume (every Sunday by default)
8. **CloudWatch log group** to keep app container logs
9. **S3** bucket to keep ALB logs
10. **Security group**s for app instance and ALB
11. **Route53** records for domain name registration (default subdomain level)
12. **Ansible** playbooks to provision app container and data volume
13. Everything is written in **Terraform**, highly modulized

## Prerequisites

1. [Terraform CLI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) `>= 1.2`
2. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) (with credentials
   configured)
3. S3 backend (a S3 bucket for state and a DynamoDB table for lock)
4. A personal domain, Route 53 hosted zone, and an ACM certificate. (preferably for the apex domain, which is subject to
   all subdomains as well)
5. SSH keypair, for connecting app instance.
6. [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) (for provisioning
   playbooks)
7. [terraform-docs](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/installation/)
8. Node.js + Yarn (for development scripts and utilities)
9. SQLite DB Browser (optional, for manually tweaking app db)
10. Basic utilities `ssh`, `scp`, `jq` (for development scripts)
11. Code editor/IDE ofc üòâ

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone from github
git clone git@github.com:cednore/trilium.git

# Cd into repo directory
cd trilium

# Install nodejs modules
yarn install

# Initialize terraform project
terraform init

# Select stage
yarn stage production # or other stages

# Download private key and tfvars file from backend bucket
yarn download:private-key
yarn download:tfvars
```

## Development scripts

### Selecting stage

```bash
# Select production stage
yarn stage production
```

### Outputs

```bash
# Terraform output in json format
yarn output:json
```

### Generating terraform graph

```bash
# Generate terraform graph and convert into svg format (requires graphviz)
yarn graph
```

### Downloading/uploading keypair and tfvars from/to backend bucket

```bash
# Download keypair from backend bucket
yarn download:private-key

# Download tfvars from backend bucket
yarn download:tfvars

# Upload keypair to backend bucket
yarn upload:private-key

# Upload tfvars to backend bucket
yarn upload:tfvars
```

### Generating a new keypair

```bash
# Generate a new keypair, if you don't have one already
yarn key:generate
```

### Linting & validation

```bash
# Lint tf files
yarn lint

# Lint tf files and fix
yarn lint:fix

# Validate terraform project
terraform validate
```

### Interacting with live server

```bash
# Open a ssh session into app instance
yarn connect

# Restart app container (this fixes broken notes and branches)
yarn restart:app

# Download app db file (sqlite)
yarn download:db

# Upload app db file
yarn upload:db
```

### Terraform documentation

This project uses [**terraform-docs**](https://terraform-docs.io) to auto-generate markdown document of terraform
resources being used. You can run following command to run the generator.

```bash
yarn tf-docs
```

Generated document will be stored at [`docs/terraform.md`](docs/terraform.md).

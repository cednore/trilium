# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send a detailed mail to **cednore@gmail.com** to report vulnerabilities in this repository.

Even when unsure whether the bug in question is an exploitable vulnerability, it is recommended to submit an
[issue](https://github.com/cednore/trilium/issues) and attach [`security`](https://github.com/cednore/trilium/labels)
label.

Critical vulnerabilities are expected to be discussed only on email threads, and not in public, until the official
announcement has been made.

Examples for details to include:

- Ideally a short description (or a script) to demonstrate an exploit.
- The affected platforms and scenarios (the vulnerability might only affect setups with case-sensitive file systems, for
  example).
- The name and affiliation of the security researchers who are involved in the discovery, if any.
- Whether the vulnerability has already been disclosed.
- How long an embargo would be required to be safe.
